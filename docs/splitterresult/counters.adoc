:context: counters

Infinispan also has a notion of counters and the Quarkus Infinispan client supports them out of
the box.

The Quarkus Infinispan client extension allows for Dependency Injection
of the `CounterManager` directly. All you need to do is annotate your field, constructor or method
and you get it with no fuss. You can then use counters as you would normally.
