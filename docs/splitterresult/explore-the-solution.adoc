The solution repository located in the `security-jwt-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-jwt-quickstart[directory] contains all of the versions we have
worked through in this quickstart guide as well as some additional endpoints that illustrate subresources with injection
of ``JsonWebToken``s and their claims into those using the CDI APIs. We suggest that you check out the quickstart solutions and
explore the `security-jwt-quickstart` directory to learn more about the {extension-name} extension features.
