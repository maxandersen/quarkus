= Near Caching
:context: near-caching

Near caching is disabled by default, but you can enable it by setting the profile config property
`quarkus.infinispan-client.near-cache-max-entries` to a value greater than 0. You can also configure
a regular expression so that only a subset of caches have near caching applied through the
`quarkus.infinispan-client.near-cache-name-pattern` attribute.
