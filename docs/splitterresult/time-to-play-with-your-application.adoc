You can now interact with your REST service:

* start Quarkus with `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev`
* open a browser to `http://localhost:8080/`
* search for authors or book titles (we initialized some data for you)
* create new authors and books and search for them too

As you can see, all your updates are automatically synchronized to the Elasticsearch cluster.
