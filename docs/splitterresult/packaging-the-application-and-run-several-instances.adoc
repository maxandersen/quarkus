= Packaging the application and run several instances
:context: packaging-the-application-and-run-several-instances

The application can be packaged using `./mvnw clean package`. Once the build is successful, run the below command:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose up --scale tasks=2 --scale nginx=1 <1>
----

[arabic]
. Start two instances of the application and a load balancer

After a few seconds, in another terminal, run `curl localhost:8080/tasks` to verify that tasks were only created at different instants and in an interval of 10 seconds.

You can also generate the native executable with `./mvnw clean package -Pnative`.
