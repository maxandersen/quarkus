Templates can be rendered as a `CompletionStage<String>` (completed with the rendered output asynchronously) or as `Publisher<String>` containing the rendered chunks:

[source,java]
----
CompletionStage<String> async = template.data("name", "neo").renderAsync();
Publisher<String> publisher = template.data("name", "neo").publisher();
----

In the case of a `Publisher`, the template is rendered chunk by chunk following the requests from the subscriber.
The rendering is not started until a subscriber requests it.
The returned `Publisher` is an instance of `io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi`.

It is possible to create an instance of `io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni` as follows:

[source,java]
----
Uni<String> uni = Uni.createFrom().completionStage(() -> template.data("name", "neo").renderAsync());
----

In this case, the rendering only starts once the subscriber requests it.
