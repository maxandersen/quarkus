= Tracing with AWS XRay and GraalVM

If you are building native images, and want to use https://aws.amazon.com/xray[AWS X-Ray Tracing] with your lambda
you will need to include `quarkus-amazon-lambda-xray` as a dependency in your pom.  The AWS X-Ray
library is not fully compatible with GraalVM so we had to do some integration work to make this work.
