= Roles mapping
:context: roles-mapping

Roles are mapped from one of the claims of the introspection endpoint response. By default, it's the `scope` claim. Roles are obtained by splitting the claim with a space separator. If the claim is an array, no splitting is done, the roles are obtained from the array.

You can customize the name of the claim to use for the roles with the `quarkus.oauth2.role-claim` property.
