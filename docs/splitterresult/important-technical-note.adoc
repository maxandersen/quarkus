Please note that the Spring support in Quarkus does not start a Spring Application Context nor are any Spring infrastructure classes run.
Spring classes and annotations are only used for reading metadata and / or are used as user code method return types or parameter types.
What that means for end users, is that adding arbitrary Spring libraries will not have any effect. Moreover Spring infrastructure
classes (like `org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor` for example) will not be executed.
