The Neo4j driver can be configured with standard Quarkus properties:

.src/main/resources/application.properties
[source]
----
quarkus.neo4j.uri = bolt://localhost:7687
quarkus.neo4j.authentication.username = neo4j
quarkus.neo4j.authentication.password = secret
----

You'll recognize the authentication here that you passed on to the docker command above.

Having done that, the driver is ready to use, there are however other configuration options, detailed below.
