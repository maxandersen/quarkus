= Why Elasticsearch only?

Hibernate Search supports both a Lucene backend and an Elasticsearch backend.

In the context of Quarkus and to build microservices, we thought the latter would make more sense.
Thus we focused our efforts on it.

We don't have plans to support the Lucene backend in Quarkus for now.
