= The problem fact and planning entity properties

Furthermore, OptaPlanner needs to know which `Lesson` instances it can change
as well as how to retrieve the `Timeslot` and `Room` instances used for score calculation
by your `TimeTableConstraintProvider`.

The `timeslotList` and `roomList` fields have an `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation,
so your `TimeTableConstraintProvider` can select _from_ those instances.

The `lessonList` has an `@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty` annotation,
so OptaPlanner can change them during solving
and your `TimeTableConstraintProvider` can select _from_ those too.
