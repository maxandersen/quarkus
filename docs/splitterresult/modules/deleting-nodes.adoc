= Deleting nodes

Finally, we want to get rid of fruits again and we add the `DELETE` method:

.src/main/java/org/acme/neo4j/FruitResource.java
[source,java]
----
@DELETE
@Path("{id}")
public CompletionStage<Response> delete(@PathParam("id") Long id) {

    AsyncSession session = driver.asyncSession();
    return session
        .writeTransactionAsync(tx -> tx
            .runAsync("MATCH (f:Fruit) WHERE id(f) = $id DELETE f", Values.parameters("id", id))
            .thenCompose(fn -> fn.consumeAsync()) // <1>
        )
        .thenCompose(response -> session.closeAsync())
        .thenApply(signal -> Response.noContent().build());
}

<1> There is no result for us, only a summary of the query executed.
A request may look like this

[source,shell]
----
curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/fruits/42
----

And that's already the most simple CRUD application with one type of nodes.
Feel free to add relationships to the model.
One idea would be to model recipes that contain fruits.
The Cypher manual linked in the introduction will help you with modelling your queries.
