= Using CompletionStages or Publisher API

If you are facing an API using `CompletionStage`, `CompletableFuture`, or `Publisher`, you can convert back and forth.
First, both `Uni` and `Multi` can be created from a `CompletionStage` or from a `Supplier<CompletionStage>`. For example:

[source,java]
----
CompletableFuture<String> future = Uni
        // Create from a Completion Stage
        .createFrom().completionStage(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "hello"));
----

On `Uni`, you can also produce a `CompletionStage` using `subscribeAsCompletionStage()` that produces a `CompletionStage` that would get the item or failure emitted by the `Uni`.

You can also create `Unis` and `Multis` from instances of `Publisher` using `createFrom().publisher(Publisher)`.
You can transform a `Uni` into a `Publisher` using `toMulti`.
Indeed, `Multi` implements `Publisher`.
