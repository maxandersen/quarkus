= Providing a certificate and key file

If the certificate has not been loaded into a keystore, it can be provided directly using the properties listed below.
Quarkus will first try to load the given files as resources, and uses the filesystem as a fallback.
The certificate / key pair will be loaded into a newly created keystore on startup.

Your `application.properties` would then look like this:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.file=/path/to/certificate
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-file=/path/to/key
