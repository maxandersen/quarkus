= Add YAML Config Support

You might want to use YAML over properties for configuration.
Since link:https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye Config] brings support for YAML
configuration, Quarkus supports this as well.

First you will need to add the YAML extension to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-config-yaml</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Or you can alternatively run this command in the directory containing your Quarkus project:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="config-yaml"
----

Now Quarkus can read YAML configuration files.
The config directories and priorities are the same as before.

====
Quarkus will choose an `application.yaml` over an `application.properties`.
YAML files are just an alternative way to configure your application.
You should decide and keep one configuration type to avoid errors.
