= Why Hibernate Search 6 (and not a fully supported version)?

To optimize the Hibernate Search bootstrap for Quarkus, the Hibernate team had to reorganize things a bit (collect the metadata offline, start the Elasticsearch client later...).

This couldn't be done in the 5.x code base so we decided to go with the in-progress Hibernate Search 6.
