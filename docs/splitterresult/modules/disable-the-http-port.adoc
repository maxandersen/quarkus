= Disable the HTTP port

It is possible to disable the HTTP port and only support secure requests. This is done via the
`quarkus.http.insecure-requests` property in `application.properties`. There are three possible
values:

`enabled`:: The default, HTTP works as normal
`redirect`:: HTTP requests will be redirected to the HTTPS port
`disabled`:: The HTTP port will not be opened.

if you use `redirect` or `disabled` and have not added a SSL certificate or keystore, your server will not start!
