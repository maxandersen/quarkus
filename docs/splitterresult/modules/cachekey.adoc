[id="cachekey_{context}"]
= @CacheKey

When a method argument is annotated with `@CacheKey`, it is identified as a part of the cache key during an invocation of a
method annotated with `@CacheResult` or `@CacheInvalidate`.

This annotation is optional and should only be used when some of the method arguments are NOT part of the cache key.
