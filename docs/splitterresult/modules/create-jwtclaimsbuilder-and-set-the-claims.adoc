= Create JwtClaimsBuilder and set the claims

The first step is to initialize a `JwtClaimsBuilder` using one of the options below and add some claims to it:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.Collections;
import io.smallrye.jwt.build.Jwt;
import io.smallrye.jwt.build.JwtClaimsBuilder;
...
// Create an empty builder and add some claims
JwtClaimsBuilder builder1 = Jwt.claims();
builder1.claim("customClaim", "custom-value").issuer("https://issuer.org");

// Builder created from the existing claims
JwtClaimsBuilder builder2 = Jwt.claims("/tokenClaims.json");

// Builder created from a map of claims
JwtClaimsBuilder builder3 = Jwt.claims(Collections.singletonMap("customClaim", "custom-value"));
----

The API is fluent so the builder initialization can be done as part of the fluent API sequence. The builder will also set `iat` (issued at) to the current time, `exp` (expires at) to 5 minutes away from the current time and `jti` (unique token identifier) claims if they have not already been set, so one can skip setting them when possible.

The next step is to decide how to secure the claims.
