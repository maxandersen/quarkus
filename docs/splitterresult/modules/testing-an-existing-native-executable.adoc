= Testing an existing native executable

It is also possible to re-run the tests against a native executable that has already been built. To do this run
`./mvnw test-compile failsafe:integration-test`. This will discover the existing native image and run the tests against it using
failsafe.

If the process cannot find the native image for some reason, or you want to test a native image that is no longer in the
target directory you can specify the executable with the `-Dnative.image.path=` system property.
