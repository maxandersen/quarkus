= Exception handler method parameter types

The following parameter types are supported, in arbitrary order:

* An exception argument: declared as a general `Exception` or as a more specific exception. This also serves as a mapping hint if the annotation itself does not narrow the exception types through its `value()`.
* Request and/or response objects (typically from the Servlet API). You may choose any specific request/response type, e.g. `ServletRequest` / `HttpServletRequest`. To use Servlet API, the `quarkus-undertow` dependency needs to be added.

Other parameter types mentioned in the Spring `https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ExceptionHandler.html[ExceptionHandler javadoc]` are not supported.
