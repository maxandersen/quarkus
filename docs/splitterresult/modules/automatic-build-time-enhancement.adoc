= Automatic build time enhancement

Hibernate ORM can use build time enhanced entities; normally this is not mandatory but it's useful and will have your
applications perform better.

Typically you would need to adapt your build scripts to include the Hibernate Enhancement plugins; in Quarkus this is
not necessary as the enhancement step is integrated in the build and analysis of the Quarkus application.
