= Setup Neo4j

The easiest way to start a Neo4j instance is a locally installed Docker environment.

[source,shell,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
docker run --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 -e 'NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/secret' neo4j:{neo4j_version}
----

This starts a Neo4j instance, that publishes its Bolt port on `7687` and a web interface on http://localhost:7474.
