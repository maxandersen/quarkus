= Simplified Constructor Injection

In CDI, a normal scoped bean must always declare a no-args constructor (this constructor is normally generated by the compiler unless you declare any other constructor).
However, this requirement complicates constructor injection - you need to provide a dummy no-args constructor to make things work in CDI.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCoolService {

  private SimpleProcessor processor;

  MyCoolService() { // dummy constructor needed
  }

  @Inject // constructor injection
  MyCoolService(SimpleProcessor processor) {
    this.processor = processor;
  }
}
----

There is no need to declare dummy constructors for normal scoped bean in Quarkus - they are generated automatically.
Also if there's only one constructor there is no need for `@Inject`.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyCoolService {

  private SimpleProcessor processor;

  MyCoolService(SimpleProcessor processor) {
    this.processor = processor;
  }
}

====
We don't generate a no-args constructor automatically if a bean class extends a class that does not declare a no-args constructor.
