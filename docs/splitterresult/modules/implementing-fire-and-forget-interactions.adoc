= Implementing fire and forget interactions

You don't have to reply to received messages.
Typically for a _fire and forget_ interaction, the messages are consumed and the sender does not need to know about it.
To implement this, your consumer method just returns `void`

[source,java]
----
@ConsumeEvent("greeting")
public void consume(String event) {
    // Do something with the event
}
