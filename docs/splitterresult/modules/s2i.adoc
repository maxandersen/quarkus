The extension `quarkus-container-image-s2i` is using s2i binary builds in order to perform container builds inside the Openshift cluster.
The idea behind the binary build is that you just upload the the artifact and its dependencies to the cluster and during the build they will be merged to a builder image (defaults to `fabric8/s2i-java`).

The benefit of this approach, is that it can be combined with Openshift's `DeploymentConfig` that makes it easy to rollout changes to the cluster.

To use this image extension, you just need to add the following dependency into your project.

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-container-image-s2i</artifactId>
    </dependency>

S2i builds, require creating a `BuildConfig` and two `ImageStream` resources, one of the builder image and one for the output image.
The creation of such objects is being taken care of by the Quarkus kubernetes extension.
