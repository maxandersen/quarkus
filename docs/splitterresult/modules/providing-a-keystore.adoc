= Providing a keystore

An alternate solution is to directly provide a keystore which already contains a default entry with a certificate
 You will need to at least provide the file and a password.

As with the certificate/key file combination, Quarkus will first try to resolve the given path as a resource, before attempting to read it from the filesystem.

Add the following property to your `application.properties`:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file=/path/to/keystore
----

As an optional hint, the type of keystore can be provided as one of the options listed.
If the type is not provided, Quarkus will try to deduce it from the file extensions, defaulting to type JKS.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file-type=[one of JKS, JCEKS, P12, PKCS12, PFX]
----
