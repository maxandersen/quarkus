= Sample Test Extension

We have an extension that is used to test for regressions in the extension processing. It is located in {quarkus-tree-url}/core/test-extension directory. In this section we touch on some of the tasks an extension
author will typically need to perform using the test-extension code to illustrate how the task could be done.
