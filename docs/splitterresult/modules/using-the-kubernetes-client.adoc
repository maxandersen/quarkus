= Using the Kubernetes client

Applications that are deployed to Kubernetes and need to access the API server will usually make use of the `kubernetes-client` extension:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-kubernetes-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

To access the API server from within a Kubernetes cluster, some RBAC related resources are required (e.g. a ServiceAccount, a RoleBinding etc.).
So, when the `kubernetes-client` extension is present, the `kubernetes` extension is going to create those resources automatically, so that application will be granted the `view` role.
If more roles are required, they will have to be added manually.
