[id="clearing-properties_{context}"]
= Clearing properties

Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,
may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect
run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.

The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the
corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.
