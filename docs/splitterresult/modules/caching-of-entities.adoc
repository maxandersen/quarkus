= Caching of entities

To enable second-level cache, mark the entities that you want cached with `@javax.persistence.Cacheable`:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Cacheable
public class Country {
    int dialInCode;
    // ...
}
----

When an entity is annotated with `@Cacheable`, all its field values are cached except for collections and relations to other entities.

This means the entity can be loaded without querying the database, but be careful as it implies the loaded entity might not reflect recent changes in the database.
