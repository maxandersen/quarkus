= Deploying

To trigger a deployment:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true
----

The command above will trigger a container image build and will apply the generated Openshift resources, right after.
The generated resources are using Openshift's `DeploymentConfig` that is configured to automatically trigger a redeployment when a change in the `ImageStream` is noticed.
In other words, any container image build after the inital deployment will automatically trigger redeployment, without the need to delete, update or re-apply the generated resources.
