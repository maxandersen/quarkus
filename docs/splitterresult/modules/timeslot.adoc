[id="timeslot_{context}"]
= Timeslot

The `Timeslot` class represents a time interval when lessons are taught,
for example, `Monday 10:30 - 11:30` or `Tuesday 13:30 - 14:30`.
For simplicity's sake, all time slots have the same duration
and there are no time slots during lunch or other breaks.

A time slot has no date, because a high school schedule just repeats every week.
So there is no need for https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#continuousPlanning[continuous planning].

Create the `src/main/java/org/acme/domain/Timeslot.java` class:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.domain;

import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.LocalTime;

public class Timeslot {

    private DayOfWeek dayOfWeek;
    private LocalTime startTime;
    private LocalTime endTime;

    public Timeslot() {
    }

    public Timeslot(DayOfWeek dayOfWeek, LocalTime startTime, LocalTime endTime) {
        this.dayOfWeek = dayOfWeek;
        this.startTime = startTime;
        this.endTime = endTime;
    }

    public DayOfWeek getDayOfWeek() {
        return dayOfWeek;
    }

    public LocalTime getStartTime() {
        return startTime;
    }

    public LocalTime getEndTime() {
        return endTime;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return dayOfWeek + " " + startTime.toString();
    }

}

Because no `Timeslot` instances change during solving, a `Timeslot` is called a _problem fact_.
Such classes do not require any OptaPlanner specific annotations.

Notice the `toString()` method keeps the output short,
so it is easier to read OptaPlanner's `DEBUG` or `TRACE` log, as shown later.
