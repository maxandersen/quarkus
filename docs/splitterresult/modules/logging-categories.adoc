[id="logging-categories_{context}"]
= Logging categories

Logging is done on a per-category basis.  Each category can be independently configured.
A configuration which applies to a category will also apply to all sub-categories of that category,
unless there is a more specific matching sub-category configuration.
For every category the same settings that are configured on ( console / file / syslog ) apply.
These can also be overridden by attaching a one or more named handlers to a category. See example in <<category-named-handlers-example>>

====
The quotes shown in the property name are required as categories normally contain '.' which must
be escaped. An example is shown in <<category-example>>.
