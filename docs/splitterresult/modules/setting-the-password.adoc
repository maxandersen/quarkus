[id="setting-the-password_{context}"]
= Setting the password

In both aforementioned scenarios, a password needs to be provided to create/load the keystore with.
The password can be set in your `application.properties` (in plain-text) using the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-password=your-password
----

However, instead of providing the password as plain-text in the configuration file (which is considered bad practice), it can instead be supplied (using link:https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile config])
as the environment variable `QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD`.
This will also work in tandem with link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-environment-variables[Kubernetes secrets].

_Note: in order to remain compatible with earlier versions of Quarkus (before 0.16) the default password is set to "password". It is therefore not a mandatory parameter!_
