= Transaction Configuration

Extended configuration of the transaction is possible with the use of the `@TransactionConfiguration` annotation that is set in addition to the standard `@Transactional` annotation on your entry method or at the class level.

The `@TransactionConfiguration` annotation allows to set a timeout property, in seconds, that applies to transactions created within the annotated method.

This annotation may only be placed on the top level method delineating the transaction.
Annotated nested methods once a transaction has started will throw an exception.

If defined on a class, it is equivalent to defining it on all the methods of the class marked with `@Transactional`.
The configuration defined on a method takes precedence over the configuration defined on a class.
