= Disable fallback images

Fallback native images are a feature of GraalVM to "fall back" to run your application in the normal JVM, should the compilation
to native code fail for some reason.

Quarkus disables this feature by setting `-H:FallbackThreshold=0`: this will ensure you get a compilation failure rather
risking to not notice that the application is unable to really run in native mode.

If you instead want to just run in Java mode, that's totally possible: just skip the native-image build and run it as a jar.
