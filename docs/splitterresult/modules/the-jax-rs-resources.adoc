= The JAX-RS resources

During the project creation, the `src/main/java/org/acme/getting/started/GreetingResource.java` file has been created with the following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.getting.started;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class GreetingResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

It's a very simple REST endpoint, returning "hello" to requests on "/hello".

====
With Quarkus, there is no need to create an `Application` class. It's supported, but not required. In addition, only one instance
of the resource is created and not one per request. You can configure this using the different `*Scoped` annotations (`ApplicationScoped`, `RequestScoped`, etc).
