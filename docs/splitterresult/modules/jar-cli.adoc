= Jar CLI

Download the jar-file here:
* https://coming-soon[jar-file] (coming soon)

As with the native CLI we recommend that you copy the binary to a specific folder, eg '~/quarkus'.
The jar file requires Java 8 or newer to run. To start the CLI:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -jar quarkus-cli.jar
----

The jar file CLI accepts all the same options and commands as the native binary.

Note: In the examples below switch out 'quarkus' with 'java -jar quarkus-cli.jar'.
