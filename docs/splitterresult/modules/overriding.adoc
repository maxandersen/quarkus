= Overriding

The extension also allows application code to override either of  `io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.Config` or `io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.KubernetesClient` which are
normally provided by the extension by simply declaring custom versions of those beans.

An example of this can be seen in the following snippet:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class KubernetesClientProducer {

    @Produces
    public KubernetesClient kubernetesClient() {
        // here you would create a custom client
        return new DefaultKubernetesClient();
    }
}
