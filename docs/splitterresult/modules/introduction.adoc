Analysis is a big part of full text search: it defines how text will be processed when indexing or building search queries.

The role of analyzers is to split the text into tokens (~ words) and filter them (making it all lowercase and removing accents for instance).

Normalizers are a special type of analyzers that keeps the input as a single token.
It is especially useful for sorting or indexing keywords.

There are a lot of bundled analyzers but you can also develop your own for your own specific purposes.

You can learn more about the Elasticsearch analysis framework in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html[Analysis section of the Elasticsearch documentation].
