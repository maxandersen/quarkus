= Matching multiple paths: longest wins

Matching is always done on a longest path basis, less specific permission sets are not considered if a more specific one
has been matched:

quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=/public/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.policy=permit
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.methods=GET,HEAD

quarkus.http.auth.permission.deny1.paths=/public/forbidden-folder/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.deny1.policy=deny

====
Given the above permission set, `GET /public/forbidden-folder/foo` would match both permission sets' paths,
but because it matches the `deny1` permission set's path on a longer match, `deny1` will be chosen and the request will
be rejected.
