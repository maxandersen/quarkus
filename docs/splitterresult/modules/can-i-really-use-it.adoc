= Can I really use it?

While Hibernate Search 6 is still at Beta stage, the code is of production quality and can be relied on.

What we don't guarantee is that there might be API changes along the way to the final release of Hibernate Search 6 and you might have to adapt your code.

If it is not a major issue for you, then sure you can use it.
