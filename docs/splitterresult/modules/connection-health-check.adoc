= Connection Health Check

If you are using the `quarkus-smallrye-health` extension, `quarkus-neo4j` will automatically add a readiness health check
to validate the connection to Neo4j.

So when you access the `/health/ready` endpoint of your application you will have information about the connection validation status.

This behavior can be disabled by setting the `quarkus.neo4j.health.enabled` property to `false` in your `application.properties`.
