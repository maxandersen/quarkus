= Install JVMCI

Before anything can be done you must first install a JVMCI build.

These can be downloaded from OTN
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/downloads/index.html[here]

Note, if you are installing on an alternative system, you can use the
developer tools on chrome or firefox to capture a direct URL with an
auth param.

After obtaining the download install it and set `JAVA_HOME`

[source,shell]

wget -O jvmci.tgz http://download.oracle.com/otn/utilities_drivers/oracle-labs/labsjdk-8u202-jvmci-0.56-darwin-amd64.tar.gz?AuthParam=[GENERATED AUTH TOKEN HERE]
tar -xzvf jvmci.tgz -C /opt
# On Mac do labsjdk1.8.0_202-jvmci-0.56/Contents/Home
