= Controlling the test port

While Quarkus will listen on port `8080` by default, when running tests it defaults to `8081`. This allows you to run
tests while having the application running in parallel.

[TIP,textlabel="Tip",name="tip"]
====
You can configure the port used by tests by configuring `quarkus.http.test-port` in your `application.properties`:[source]
----
quarkus.http.test-port=8083

====

Quarkus also provides RestAssured integration that updates the default port used by RestAssured before the tests are run,
so no additional configuration should be required.
