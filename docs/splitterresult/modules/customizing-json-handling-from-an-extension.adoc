= Customizing JSON handling from an extension

Extensions often need to register serializers and/or deserializers for types the extension provides.

For this, both JSON-B and Jackson extension provide a way to register serializer/deserializer from within an
extension deployment module.

Keep in mind that not everybody will need JSON, so you need to make it optional.

If an extension intends to provide JSON related customization,
it is strongly advised to provide customization for both JSON-B and Jackson.
