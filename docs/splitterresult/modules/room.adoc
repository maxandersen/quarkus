[id="room_{context}"]
= Room

The `Room` class represents a location where lessons are taught,
for example, `Room A` or `Room B`.
For simplicity's sake, all rooms are without capacity limits
and they can accommodate all lessons.

Create the `src/main/java/org/acme/domain/Room.java` class:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.domain;

public class Room {

    private String name;

    public Room() {
    }

    public Room(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name;
    }

}
----

`Room` instances do not change during solving, so `Room` is also a _problem fact_.
