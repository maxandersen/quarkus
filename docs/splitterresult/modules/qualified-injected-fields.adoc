= Qualified Injected Fields

In CDI, if you declare a field injection point you need to use `@Inject` and optionally a set of qualifiers:

[source,java]
----
  @Inject
  @ConfigProperty(name = "cool")
  String coolProperty;
----

In Quarkus, you can skip the `@Inject` annotation completely if an injected field declares at least one qualifier:

[source,java]
----
  @ConfigProperty(name = "cool")
  String coolProperty;
----

[NOTE,textlabel="Note",name="note"]
====
With the notable exception of one special case discussed below, `@Inject` is still required for constructor and method injection.
