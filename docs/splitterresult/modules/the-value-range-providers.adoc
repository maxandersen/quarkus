[id="the-value-range-providers_{context}"]
= The value range providers

That `timeslotList` field is a value range provider.
It holds the `Timeslot` instances which OptaPlanner can pick from to assign to the `timeslot` field of `Lesson` instances.
The `timeslotList` field has an `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation to connect those two,
by matching the `id` with the `valueRangeProviderRefs` of the `@PlanningVariable` in the `Lesson`.

Following the same logic, the `roomList` field also has an `@ValueRangeProvider` annotation.
