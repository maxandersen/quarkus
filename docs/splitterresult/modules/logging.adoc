When adding constraints in your `ConstraintProvider`,
keep an eye on the _score calculation speed_ in the `info` log,
after solving for the same amount of time, to assess the performance impact:

... Solving ended: ..., score calculation speed (29455/sec), ...

To understand how OptaPlanner is solving your problem internally,
change the logging in the `application.properties` file or with a `-D` system property:

[source,properties]

quarkus.log.category."org.optaplanner".level=debug

Use `debug` logging to show every _step_:

[source,nowrap-option=""]
----
... Solving started: time spent (67), best score (-20init/0hard/0soft), environment mode (REPRODUCIBLE), random (JDK with seed 0).
...     CH step (0), time spent (128), score (-18init/0hard/0soft), selected move count (15), picked move ([Math(101) {null -> Room A}, Math(101) {null -> MONDAY 08:30}]).
...     CH step (1), time spent (145), score (-16init/0hard/0soft), selected move count (15), picked move ([Physics(102) {null -> Room A}, Physics(102) {null -> MONDAY 09:30}]).

Use `trace` logging to show every _step_ and every _move_ per step.
