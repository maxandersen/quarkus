This section is provided as high level guidance, but can't presume to be comprehensive as some flags are controlled
 dynamically by the extensions, the platform you're building on, configuration details, your code and possibly
 a combination of any of these.

Generally speaking the ones listed here are those most likely to affect performance metrics, but in the right
circumstances one could observe non negligible impact from the other flags too.

If you're to investigate some differences in detail make sure to check what Quarkus is invoking exactly: when the build
plugin is producing a native image, the full command lines are logged.
