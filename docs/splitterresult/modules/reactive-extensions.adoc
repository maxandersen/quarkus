If your `@Transactional`-annotated method returns a reactive value, such as:

- `CompletionStage` (from the JDK)
- `Publisher` (from  Reactive-Streams)
- Any type which can be converted to one of the two previous types using Reactive Type Converters

then the behaviour is a bit different, because the transaction will not be terminated until the
returned reactive value is terminated. In effect, the returned reactive value will be listened to
and if it terminates exceptionally the transaction will be marked for rollback, and will be committed
or rolled-back only at termination of the reactive value.

This allows your reactive methods to keep on working on the transaction asynchronously until their
work is really done, and not just until the reactive method returns.

If you need to propagate your transaction context across your reactive pipeline, please see the
link:context-propagation[Context Propagation guide].
