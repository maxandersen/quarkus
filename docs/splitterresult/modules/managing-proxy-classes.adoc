= Managing Proxy Classes

While writing native application you'll need to define proxy classes at image build time by specifying the list of interfaces that they implement.

In such a situation, the error you might encounter is:

[source]
----
com.oracle.svm.core.jdk.UnsupportedFeatureError: Proxy class defined by interfaces [interface org.apache.http.conn.HttpClientConnectionManager, interface org.apache.http.pool.ConnPoolControl, interface com.amazonaws.http.conn.Wrapped] not found. Generating proxy classes at runtime is not supported. Proxy classes need to be defined at image build time by specifying the list of interfaces that they implement. To define proxy classes use -H:DynamicProxyConfigurationFiles=<comma-separated-config-files> and -H:DynamicProxyConfigurationResources=<comma-separated-config-resources> options.
----

Solving this issue requires adding the `-H:DynamicProxyConfigurationResources=<comma-separated-config-resources>` option and to provide a dynamic proxy configuration file.
You can find all the information about the format of this file in https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/DYNAMIC_PROXY.md#manual-configuration[the GraalVM documentation].
