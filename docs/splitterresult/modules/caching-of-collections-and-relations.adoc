= Caching of collections and relations

Collections and relations need to be individually annotated to be cached; in this case the Hibernate specific `@org.hibernate.annotations.Cache` should be used, which requires also to specify the `CacheConcurrencyStrategy`:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

@Entity
@Cacheable
public class Country {
    // ...

    @OneToMany
    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_ONLY)
    List<City> cities;

    // ...
}
