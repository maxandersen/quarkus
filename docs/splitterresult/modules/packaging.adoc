= Packaging

Packaging your application is as simple as `./mvnw clean package`.
It can be run with `java -jar target/neo4j-quickstart-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

With GraalVM installed, you can also create a native executable binary: `./mvnw clean package -Dnative`.
Depending on your system, that will take some time.
