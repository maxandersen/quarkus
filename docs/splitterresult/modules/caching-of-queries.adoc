= Caching of queries

Queries can also benefit from second-level caching. Cached query results can be returned immediately to the caller, avoiding to run the query on the database.

Be careful as this implies the results might not reflect recent changes.

To cache a query, mark it as cacheable on the `Query` instance:

[source,java]
----
Query query = ...
query.setHint("org.hibernate.cacheable", Boolean.TRUE);
----

If you have a `NamedQuery` then you can enable caching directly on its definition, which will usually be on an entity:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@NamedQuery(name = "Fruits.findAll",
      query = "SELECT f FROM Fruit f ORDER BY f.name",
      hints = @QueryHint(name = "org.hibernate.cacheable", value = "true") )
public class Fruit {
   ...
----

That's all! Caching technology is already integrated and enabled by default in Quarkus, so it's enough to set which ones are safe to be cached.
