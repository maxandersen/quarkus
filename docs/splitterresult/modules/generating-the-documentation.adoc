= Generating the documentation

Generating the documentation is easy:

* Running `./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs` will do.
* You  can either do it globally or in a specific extension directory (e.g. `extensions/mailer`).

The documentation is generated in the global `target/asciidoc/generated/config/` located at the root of the project.
