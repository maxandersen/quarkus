= Defining the analyzers used

When we added the Hibernate Search annotations to our entities, we defined the analyzers and normalizers used.
Typically:

[source,java]
----
@FullTextField(analyzer = "english")
----

[source,java]
----
@FullTextField(analyzer = "name")
----

[source,java]
----
@KeywordField(name = "lastName_sort", sortable = Sortable.YES, normalizer = "sort")
----

We use:

* an analyzer called `name` for person names,
* an analyzer called `english` for book titles,
* a normalizer called `sort` for our sort fields

but we haven't set them up yet.

Let's see how you can do it with Hibernate Search.
