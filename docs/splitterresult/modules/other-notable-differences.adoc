Format of `import.sql`:: When importing a `import.sql` to setup your database, keep in mind that Quarkus reconfigures Hibernate ORM so to require a semicolon (';') to terminate each statement.
The default in Hibernate is to have a statement per line, without requiring a terminator other than newline: remember to convert your scripts to use the ';' terminator character if you're reusing existing scripts.
This is useful so to allow multi-line statements and human friendly formatting.
