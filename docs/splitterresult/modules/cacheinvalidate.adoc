[id="cacheinvalidate_{context}"]
= @CacheInvalidate

Removes an entry from the cache.

When a method annotated with `@CacheInvalidate` is invoked, Quarkus will compute a cache key and use it to try to remove an existing entry from the cache.
If the method has one or more arguments, the key computation is done from all the method arguments if none of them is annotated with `@CacheKey`, or all the arguments annotated with `@CacheKey` otherwise.
This annotation can also be used on a method with no arguments, a default key derived from the cache name is generated in that case.
If the key does not identify any cache entry, nothing will happen.

====
If the `@CacheResult` or `@CacheInvalidate` annotations are used on a method with no parameters, a unique default cache key derived from the cache name will be generated and used.
