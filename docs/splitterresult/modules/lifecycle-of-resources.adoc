= Lifecycle of Resources

In Quarkus all JAX-RS resources are treated as CDI beans.
It's possible to inject other beans via `@Inject`, bind interceptors using bindings such as `@Transactional`, define `@PostConstruct` callbacks, etc.

If there is no scope annotation declared on the resource class then the scope is defaulted.
The default scope can be controlled through the `quarkus.resteasy.singleton-resources` property.
If set to `true` (default) then a *single instance* of a resource class is created to service all requests (as defined by `@javax.inject.Singleton`).
If set to `false` then a *new instance* of the resource class is created per each request.
An explicit CDI scope annotation (`@RequestScoped`, `@ApplicationScoped`, etc.) always overrides the default behavior and specifies the lifecycle of resource instances.
