The request context is also active:

* during notification of a synchronous observer method.

The request context is destroyed:

* after the observer notification completes for an event, if it was not already active when the notification started.

====
An event with qualifier `@Initialized(RequestScoped.class)` is fired when the request context is initialized for an observer notification. Moreover, the events with qualifiers `@BeforeDestroyed(RequestScoped.class)` and `@Destroyed(RequestScoped.class)` are fired when the request context is destroyed.
