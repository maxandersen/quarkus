= Uber-Jar Creation

Quarkus Maven plugin supports the generation of Uber-Jars by specifying a `quarkus.package.uber-jar=true` configuration option in your `application.properties`.

The original jar will still be present in the `target` directory but it will be renamed to contain the `.original` suffix.

When building an Uber-Jar you can specify entries that you want to exclude from the generated jar by using the `quarkus.package.ignored-entries` configuration
option, this takes a comma seperated list of entries to ignore.

Uber-Jar creation by default excludes link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/intro.html[signature files] that might be present in the dependencies of the application.

Uber-Jar's final name is configurable via a Maven's build settings `finalName` option.
