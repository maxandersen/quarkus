= Defining a Docker registry

The Docker registry can be specified with the following property:

[source]
----
quarkus.container-image.registry=http://my.docker-registry.net
----

By adding this property along with the rest of the container-image properties of the previous section, the generated manifests will use the image `http://my.docker-registry.net/quarkus/demo-app:1.0`.
The image is not the only thing that can be customized in the generated manifests, as will become evident in the following sections.
