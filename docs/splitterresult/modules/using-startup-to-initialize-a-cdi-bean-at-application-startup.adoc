= Using <code>@Startup</code> to initialize a CDI bean at application startup

A bean represented by a class, producer method or field annotated with `@Startup` is initialized at application startup:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.lifecycle;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Startup // <1>
@ApplicationScoped
public class EagerAppBean {

   private final String name;

   EagerAppBean(NameGenerator generator) { // <2>
     this.name = generator.createName();
   }
}

. For each bean annotated with `@Startup` a synthetic observer of `StartupEvent` is generated. The default priority is used.
. The bean constructor is called when the application starts and the resulting contextual instance is stored in the application context.

====
`@Dependent` beans are destroyed immediately afterwards to follow the behavior of observers declared on `@Dependent` beans.

====
If a class is annotated with `@Startup` but with no scope annotation then `@ApplicationScoped` is added automatically.
