= Matching path but not method

If a request would match one or more permission sets based on the path, but does not match any due to method requirements
then the request is rejected.

====
Given the above permission set, `GET /public/foo` would match both the path and method and thus be allowed,
whereas `POST /public/foo` would match the path but not the method and would thus be rejected.
