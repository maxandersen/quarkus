= Cloud Native Memory Limits

It is important to measure the whole memory to see the impact of a Cloud Native application.
It is particularly true of container environments which will kill a process based on its full RSS memory usage.

Likewise, don't fall into the trap of only measuring private memory which is what the process uses that is not shareable with other processes.
While private memory might be useful in a environment deploying many different applications (and thus sharing memory a lot),
it is very misleading in environments like Kubernetes/OpenShift.
