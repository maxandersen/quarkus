= Generate some values for the metrics

First, ask the endpoint whether some numbers are prime numbers.

....
curl localhost:8080/350
....

The application will respond that 350 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 2.

Now for some large prime number so that the test takes a bit more time:

....
curl localhost:8080/629521085409773
....

The application will respond that 629521085409773 is a prime number.
If you want, try some more calls with numbers of your choice.
