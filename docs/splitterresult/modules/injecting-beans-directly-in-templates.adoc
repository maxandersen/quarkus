= Injecting Beans Directly In Templates

A CDI bean annotated with `@Named` can be referenced in any template through the `inject` namespace:

[source,html]
----
{inject:foo.price} <1>
----
[arabic]
<1> First, a bean with name `foo` is found and then used as the base object.
All expressions using the `inject` namespace are validated during build.
For the expression `inject:foo.price` the implementation class of the injected bean must either have the `price` property (e.g. a `getPrice()` method) or a matching <<template_extension_methods,template extension method>> must exist.

====
A `ValueResolver` is also generated for all beans annotated with `@Named` so that it's possible to access its properties without reflection.
