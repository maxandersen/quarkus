= Current Run Modes

At the moment we have the following use cases for bootstrapping Quarkus:

- Maven creating production application
- Maven dev mode
- Gradle creating a production application
- Gradle dev mode
- QuarkusTest (Maven, Gradle and IDE)
- QuarkusUnitTest (Maven, Gradle and IDE)
- QuarkusDevModeTest (Maven, Gradle and IDE)
- Arquillian Adaptor

One of the goals of this refactor is to have all these different run modes boot Quarkus in fundamentally the same way.
