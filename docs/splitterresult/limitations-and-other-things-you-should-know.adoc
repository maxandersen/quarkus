Quarkus does not modify the libraries it uses; this rule applies to Hibernate ORM as well: when using
this extension you will mostly have the same experience as using the original library.

But while they share the same code, Quarkus does configure some components automatically and injects custom implementations
for some extension points; this should be transparent and useful but if you're an expert of Hibernate you might want to
know what is being done.
