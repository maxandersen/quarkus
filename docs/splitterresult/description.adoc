Sentry is a really easy way to be notified of errors happening in your Quarkus application.

It is a self-hosted and cloud-based error monitoring that helps software teams discover, triage, and prioritize errors in real-time.

They offer a free starter price for cloud-based or you can self host it for free.

====
Sentry's Java SDK is open source, but recently sentry.io https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry[changed the license] for their backend to the non-open source https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/LICENSE[BSL license]. This might or might not be an issue for your project and product.
