= Loading OpenAPI Schema From Static Files
:context: loading-openapi-schema-from-static-files

Instead of dynamically creating OpenAPI schemas from annotation scanning, Quarkus also supports serving static OpenAPI documents.
The static file to serve must be a valid document conforming to the https://swagger.io/docs/specification[OpenAPI specification].
An OpenAPI document that conforms to the  OpenAPI Specification is itself a valid JSON object, that can be represented in `yaml` or `json` formats.

To see this in action, we'll put OpenAPI documentation under `META-INF/openapi.yaml` for our `/fruits` endpoints.
Quarkus also supports alternative <<open-document-paths, OpenAPI document paths>> if you prefer.

By default, a request to `/openapi` will serve the combined OpenAPI document from the static file and the model generated from application endpoints code.
We can however change this to only serve the static OpenAPI document by adding `mp.openapi.scan.disable=true` configuration into `application.properties`.

Now, a request to `/openapi` endpoint will serve the static OpenAPI document instead of the generated one.

.About OpenAPI document paths
[id="open-document-paths_{context}" TIP,textlabel="Tip",name="tip",id="open-document-paths"]
====
Quarkus supports various paths to store your OpenAPI document under. We recommend you place it under `META-INF/openapi.yml`.
Alternative paths are:* `META-INF/openapi.yaml`
* `META-INF/openapi.yml`
* `META-INF/openapi.json`
* `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/openapi.yml`
* `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/openapi.yaml`
* `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/openapi.json`Live reload of static OpenAPI document is supported during development. A modification to your OpenAPI document will be picked up on fly by Quarkus.
