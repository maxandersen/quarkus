:context: how-do-we-measure-memory-usage

When measuring the footprint of a Quarkus application, we measure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_set_size[Resident Set Size (RSS)]
and not the JVM heap size which is only a small part of the overall problem.
The JVM not only allocates native memory for heap (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`) but also structures required by the jvm to run your application. Depending on the JVM implementation, the total memory allocated for an application will include, but not limited to:

* Heap space
* Class metadata
* Thread stacks
* Compiled code
* Garbage collection
