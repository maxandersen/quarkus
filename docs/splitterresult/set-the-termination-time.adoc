= Set the termination time
:context: set-the-termination-time

Without a termination setting or a termination event, the solver runs forever.
To avoid that, limit the solving time to five seconds.
That is short enough to avoid the HTTP timeout.

Create the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
# The solver runs only for 5 seconds to avoid a HTTP timeout in this simple implementation.
# It's recommended to run for at least 5 minutes ("5m") otherwise.
