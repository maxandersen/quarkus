[id="constraints_{context}"]
= Constraints
:context: constraints

In this application, we are going to test an elementary object, but we support complicated constraints and can validate graphs of objects.
Create the `org.acme.validation.Book` class with the following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.validation;

import javax.validation.constraints.NotBlank;
import javax.validation.constraints.Min;

public class Book {

    @NotBlank(message="Title may not be blank")
    public String title;

    @NotBlank(message="Author may not be blank")
    public String author;

    @Min(message="Author has been very lazy", value=1)
    public double pages;
}
----

Constraints are added on fields, and when an object is validated, the values are checked.
The getter and setter methods are also used for JSON mapping.
