= Serving Static Resources
:context: serving-static-resources

To serve static resources you must place them in the `META-INF/resources` directory of your application. This location
was chosen as it is the standard location for resources in `jar` files as defined by the Servlet spec. Even though
Quarkus can be used without Servlet following this convention allows existing code that places its resources in this
location to function correctly.
