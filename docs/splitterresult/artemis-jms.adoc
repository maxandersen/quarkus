The above steps detailed using the Qpid JMS AMQP client, however the guide can also be used
with the Artemis JMS client. Many of the individual steps are exactly as previously
<<qpid-jms-amqp, detailed above for Qpid JMS>>. The individual component code is the same.
The only differences are in the dependency for the initial project creation, and the
configuration properties used. These changes are detailed below and should be substituted
for the equivalent step during the sequence above.
