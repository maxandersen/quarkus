The application built in this guide simulates a simple backend for a gourmet coffee e-shop. It implements a REST
endpoint providing information about coffee samples we have on store.

Let's imagine, although it's not implemented as such, that some of the methods in our endpoint require communication
to external services like a database or an external microservice, which introduces a factor of unreliability.
