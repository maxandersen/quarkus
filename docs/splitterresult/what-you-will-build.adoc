You will build a REST application that optimizes a school timetable for students and teachers:

Your service will assign `Lesson` instances to `Timeslot` and `Room` instances automatically
by using AI to adhere to hard and soft scheduling _constraints_, such as:

* A room can have at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher can teach at most one lesson at the same time.
* A student can attend at most one lesson at the same time.
* A teacher prefers to teach in a single room.
* A teacher prefers to teach sequential lessons and dislikes gaps between lessons.

Mathematically speaking, school timetabling is an _NP-hard_ problem.
That means it is difficult to scale.
Simply brute force iterating through all possible combinations takes millions of years
for a non-trivial dataset, even on a supercomputer.
Luckily, AI constraint solvers such as OptaPlanner have advanced algorithms
that deliver a near-optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.
