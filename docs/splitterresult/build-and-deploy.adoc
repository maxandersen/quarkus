= Build and Deploy
:context: build-and-deploy

Build the project using maven.

[source,subs="attributes+"]

./mvnw clean install

This will compile the code and run the unit tests included within the generated project.
Unit testing is the same as any other Java project and does not require running on Amazon.  Quarkus dev-mode is also
available with this extension.

If you want to build for native too, make sure you have GraalVM installed correctly and just add a `native` property
to the build

./mvnw clean install -Dnative
