Hibernate ORM with Panache relies on compile-time bytecode enhancements to your entities.
If you define your entities in the same project where you build your Quarkus application, everything will work fine.
If the entities come from external projects or jars, you can make sure that your jar is treated like a Quarkus application library
by indexing it via Jandex, see link:cdi-reference#how-to-generate-a-jandex-index[How to Generate a Jandex Index] in the CDI guide.
This will allow Quarkus to index and enhance your entities as if they were inside the current project.
