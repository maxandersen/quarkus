Quarkus includes support for graceful shutdown, this allows Quarkus to wait for running requests to finish, up
till a set timeout. By default this is disabled, however you can configure this by setting the `quarkus.shutdown.timeout`
config property. When this is set shutdown will not happen until all running requests have completed, or until
this timeout has elapsed. This config property is a duration, and can be set using the standard
`java.time.Duration` format, if only a number is specified it is interpreted as seconds.

Extensions that accept requests need to add support for this on an individual basis. At the moment only the
HTTP extension supports this, so shutdown may still happen when messaging requests are active.
