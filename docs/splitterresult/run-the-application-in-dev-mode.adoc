= Run the application in Dev Mode
:context: run-the-application-in-dev-mode

Run the application with: `./mvnw quarkus:dev`.
After a few seconds, open another terminal and run `curl localhost:8080/tasks` to verify that we have at least one task created.

As usual, the application can be packaged using `./mvnw clean package` and executed using the `-runner.jar` file.
You can also generate the native executable with `./mvnw clean package -Pnative`.
