Encryption at this point requires additional steps to get working.

The first step is to configure the `hotrod-client.properties` file to point to your truststore
and/or keystore. This is further detailed at
https://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#hr_encryption.

The Infinispan Client extension enables SSL by default. You can read more about this
at link:native-and-ssl[Using SSL With Native Executables].
