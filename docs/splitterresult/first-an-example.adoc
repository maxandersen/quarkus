What we're doing in Panache is allow you to write your Hibernate ORM entities like this:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person extends PanacheEntity {
    public String name;
    public LocalDate birth;
    public Status status;

    public static Person findByName(String name){
        return find("name", name).firstResult();
    }

    public static List<Person> findAlive(){
        return list("status", Status.Alive);
    }

    public static void deleteStefs(){
        delete("name", "Stef");
    }
}
----

You have noticed how much more compact and readable the code is?
Does this look interesting? Read on!

the `list()` method might be surprising at first. It takes fragments of HQL (JP-QL) queries and contextualizes the rest. That makes for very concise but yet readable code.

what was described above is essentially the link:https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html[active record pattern], sometimes just called the entity pattern.
Hibernate with Panache also allows for the use of the more classical link:https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html[repository pattern] via `PanacheRepository`.
