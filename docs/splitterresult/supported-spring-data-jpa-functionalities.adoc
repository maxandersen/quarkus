Quarkus currently supports a subset of Spring Data JPA's features, namely the most useful and most commonly used features.

An important part of this support is that all repository generation is done at build time thus ensuring that all supported features work correctly in native mode.
Moreover, developers know at build time whether or not their repository method names can be converted to proper JPQL queries.
This also means that if a method name indicates that a field should be used that is not part of the Entity, developers will get
the relevant error at build time.
