Before going further, let's have a look at the HTTP layer of Quarkus.
Quarkus HTTP support is based on a non-blocking and reactive engine (Eclipse Vert.x and Netty).
All the HTTP requests your application receive are handled by _event loops_ (IO Thread) and then are routed towards the code that manages the request.
Depending on the destination, it can invoke the code managing the request on a worker thread (Servlet, Jax-RS) or use the IO Thread (reactive route).
Note that because of this, a reactive route must be non-blocking or explicitly declare its blocking nature (which would result by being called on a worker thread).
