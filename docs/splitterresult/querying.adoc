The Infinispan client supports both indexed and non indexed querying as long as the
`ProtoStreamMarshaller` is configured above. This allows the user to query based on the
properties of the proto schema.

Query builds upon the proto definitions you can configure when setting up the `ProtoStreamMarshaller`.
Either method of Serialization above will automatically register the schema with the server at
startup, meaning that you will automatically gain the ability to query objects stored in the
remote Infinispan Server.

You can read more about this at https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/developing/developing.html#query_dsl.

You can use either the Query DSL or the Ickle Query language with the Quarkus Infinispan client
extension.
