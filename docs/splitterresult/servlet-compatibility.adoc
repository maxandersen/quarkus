In Quarkus, RESTEasy can either run directly on top of the Vert.x HTTP server, or on top of Undertow if you have any servlet dependency.

As a result, certain classes, such as `HttpServletRequest` are not always available for injection. Most use-cases for this particular
class are covered by JAX-RS equivalents, except for getting the remote client's IP. RESTEasy comes with a replacement API which you can inject:
https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/4.4.2.Final/javadocs/org/jboss/resteasy/spi/HttpRequest.html[`HttpRequest`], which has the methods
https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/4.4.2.Final/javadocs/org/jboss/resteasy/spi/HttpRequest.html#getRemoteAddress--[`getRemoteAddress()`]
and https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/4.4.2.Final/javadocs/org/jboss/resteasy/spi/HttpRequest.html#getRemoteHost--[`getRemoteHost()`]
to solve this problem.
