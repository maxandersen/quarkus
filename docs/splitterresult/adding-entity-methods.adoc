= Adding entity methods
:context: adding-entity-methods

Add custom queries on your entities inside the entities themselves.
That way, you and your co-workers can find them easily, and queries are co-located with the object they operate on.
Adding them as static methods in your entity class is the Panache Active Record way.

    public LocalDate birth;

    public static Person findByName(String name){
        return find("name", name).firstResult();
    }

    public static List<Person> findAlive(){
        return list("status", Status.Alive);
    }

    public static void deleteLoics(){
        delete("name", "Lo√Øc");
    }
