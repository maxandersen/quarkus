= Read only deployment environments
:context: read-only-deployment-environments

In environments with read only file systems you may receive errors of the form:

[source]
----
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to create cache dir
----

Assuming `/tmp/` is writeable this can be fixed by setting the `vertx.cacheDirBase` property to point to a directory in `/tmp/` for instance in OpenShift by creating an environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` with the value `-Dvertx.cacheDirBase=/tmp/vertx`.
