= Intercepting HTTP requests
:context: intercepting-http-requests

You can also register filters that would intercept incoming HTTP requests.
Note that these filters are also applied for servlets, JAX-RS resources, and reactive routes.

For example, the following code snippet registers a filter adding an HTTP header:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.reactive.routes;

import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

public class MyFilters {

    @RouteFilter(100) <1>
    void myFilter(RoutingContext rc) {
       rc.response().putHeader("X-Header", "intercepting the request");
       rc.next(); <2>
    }
}
----

[arabic]
<1> The `RouteFilter#value()` defines the priority used to sort the filters - filters with higher priority are called first.
<2> The filter is likely required to call the `next()` method to continue the chain.
